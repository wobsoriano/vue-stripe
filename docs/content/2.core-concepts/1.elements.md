## Elements Overview

Stripe Elements are pre-built UI components that let you collect payment details securely. They're hosted by Stripe, which means sensitive payment information never touches your servers.

Elements provide a flexible way to securely collect payment information in your Vue app. You can mount individual Element components inside of your `Elements` provider tree.

## Elements Provider

Before using any Element components, you need to wrap your application (or the relevant part) with the `Elements` provider:

```vue
<script setup>
import { loadStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-js'
import { Elements } from 'vue-stripe'
import CheckoutForm from './CheckoutForm.vue'

const stripePromise = loadStripe('pk_test_xxx')
</script>

<template>
  <Elements :stripe="stripePromise">
    <CheckoutForm />
  </Elements>
</template>
```

## Available Element Components

There are many different kinds of Elements, useful for collecting different kinds of payment information. These are the available Elements today.

## Using Elements

All Element components follow a similar pattern:

```vue
<script setup>
import { PaymentElement } from 'vue-stripe'
</script>

<template>
  <form>
    <PaymentElement />
    <button type="submit">
      Pay
    </button>
  </form>
</template>
```

## Element Events

Elements emit events that you can listen to:

- `@ready` - Triggered when the Element is fully rendered
- `@change` - Triggered when data exposed by the Element changes
- `@focus` - Triggered when the Element receives focus
- `@blur` - Triggered when the Element loses focus
- `@escape` - Triggered when the escape key is pressed
- `@loaderstart` - Triggered when loader UI is mounted (Payment, Address, Express Checkout, Link Authentication)
- `@loadererror` - Triggered when the Element fails to load (Payment, Address, Express Checkout, Link Authentication)

## Element Options

Each Element accepts an `options` prop for configuration:

```vue
<template>
  <PaymentElement
    :options="{
      layout: 'tabs',
      business: {
        name: 'My Business',
      },
    }"
  />
</template>
```

## Accessing Element Instances

You can access the underlying Stripe element instance using the `getElement()` method:

```vue
<script setup>
import { PaymentElement, useElements } from 'vue-stripe'

const elements = useElements()

// Access the Payment Element instance
const paymentElement = elements.value?.getElement(PaymentElement)
</script>
```

For detailed information about Elements and their usage, refer to the [Stripe Elements documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements).
