## Mount your Element

Stripe Elements are automatically mounted to the DOM when you use Vue Stripe components. Understanding how they're mounted helps you integrate them effectively.

## How Elements Mount

When you use a Vue Stripe element component, it:

1. Creates a container `div` element
2. Calls the Stripe.js API to create the element instance
3. Mounts the Stripe element to the container
4. Emits lifecycle events

## Element Lifecycle

### Ready Event

The `@ready` event is emitted when the element is fully rendered and ready:

```vue
<script setup>
function handleReady() {
  console.log('Payment Element is ready')
}
</script>

<template>
  <PaymentElement @ready="handleReady" />
</template>
```

### Change Event

The `@change` event is emitted when element data changes:

```vue
<script setup>
function handleChange(event) {
  if (event.complete) {
    console.log('Card details are complete')
  }
  if (event.error) {
    console.error('Error:', event.error.message)
  }
}
</script>

<template>
  <CardElement @change="handleChange" />
</template>
```

## DOM Structure

Elements are mounted inside a container div. The structure looks like:

```html
<div id="payment-element">
  <!-- Stripe Element is mounted here -->
</div>
```

## Conditional Mounting

Elements only mount when:

- The `Elements` or `CheckoutProvider` is available
- The Stripe instance has loaded
- The component is rendered in the template

## Unmounting

Elements are automatically cleaned up when:

- The component is unmounted
- The parent `Elements` provider is removed
- The component is conditionally hidden with `v-if="false"`

## Manual Control

You can control element mounting with `v-if`:

```vue
<script setup>
const shouldShowPayment = ref(false)

function showPayment() {
  shouldShowPayment.value = true
}
</script>

<template>
  <PaymentElement v-if="shouldShowPayment" />
</template>
```
