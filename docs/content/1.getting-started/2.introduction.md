## Introduction

Vue Stripe is a comprehensive Vue wrapper for [Stripe.js and Elements](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js).

## What is Vue Stripe?

Vue Stripe is designed as a 1:1 equivalent to the [`@stripe/react-stripe-js`](https://github.com/stripe/react-stripe-js) React Stripe SDK, bringing the same powerful features and developer experience to the Vue ecosystem. It provides intuitive composables and components that feel natural in Vue applications.

The library is a thin wrapper around Stripe Elements, allowing you to add secure payment forms to any Vue app while maintaining full customization control over styling and behavior.

:::caution
The aim of this module is to have [`@stripe/react-stripe-js`](https://github.com/stripe/react-stripe-js) for Vue with feature parity. You should be able to follow the [React docs](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/react) and examples using this module. **Only use this library if you want parity with the React Stripe.js SDK.** Otherwise, consider using the [Stripe Partner Vue SDK](https://vuestripe.com).
